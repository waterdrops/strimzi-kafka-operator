= Installing a local Kubernetes cluster with Minikube

Minikube offers an easy way to get started with Kubernetes.
If a Kubernetes cluster is unavailable, you can use Minikube to create a local cluster.

You can download and install Minikube from the https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/[Kubernetes website], which also provides documentation.
Depending on the number of brokers you want to deploy inside the cluster, and whether you want to run Kafka Connect as well,
try running Minikube with at least with 4 GB of RAM instead of the default 2 GB.

Once installed, start Minikube using:

[source,shell]
minikube start --memory 4096

To interact with the cluster, install the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[`kubectl`] utility.
