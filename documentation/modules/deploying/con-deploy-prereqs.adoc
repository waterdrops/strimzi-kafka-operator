To deploy Strimzi, make sure that:

ifdef::Downloading[]
* A Kubernetes {KubernetesVersion} cluster is available.
+
If you do not have access to a Kubernetes cluster, you can install Strimzi with xref:deploy-kubernetes-{context}[_Minikube_].
* The `kubectl` command-line tool is installed and configured to connect to the running cluster.

NOTE: Strimzi supports some features that are specific to OpenShift,
where such integration benefits OpenShift users and there is no equivalent implementation using standard Kubernetes.

== `oc` and `kubectl` commands

The `oc` command functions as an alternative to `kubectl`.
In almost all cases the example `kubectl` commands used in this guide can be done using `oc` simply by replacing the command name (options and arguments remain the same).

In other words, instead of using:

[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl apply -f _your-file_

when using OpenShift you can use:

[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
oc apply -f _your-file_

NOTE: As an exception to this general rule, `oc` uses `oc adm` subcommands for _cluster management_ functionality,
whereas `kubectl` does not make this distinction.
For example, the `oc` equivalent of `kubectl taint` is `oc adm taint`.
